    the model and not a prompt, decides whether a tool call runs right away
    or just gets recorded as a proposal. Every attempt is persisted with its
    exact raw input before anything else happens, including unknown tool
    names and invalid input, so the trail can't be edited by a later model
    turn and a bad call is itself visible in the audit log.

    A side-effecting tool is never executed here. It's written down as

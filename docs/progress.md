- [x] Git repo initialized with `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configured (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- [x] GitHub Actions CI (`.github/`)
- [x] Docker Compose with Postgres + pgvector (`docker-compose.yml`)

- [x] Full product spec committed (`docs/spec.md`)

---

### ✅ Phase 1 — Database + Auth

**Checkpoint:** user can sign in/out; unauthenticated access rejected; user A cannot see user B's incidents.

- [x] Alembic configured (`backend/alembic/`, `alembic.ini`)
- [x] SQLAlchemy models (`backend/app/models.py`) — full data model from spec §7

- [x] `security.py` — password hashing, JWT encode/decode
- [x] Incident ownership enforced in incidents router (`backend/app/routers/incidents.py`)
- [x] Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_auth.py`, `tests/unit/test_incidents.py`

---

### ✅ Phase 2 — Simulated System

**Checkpoint:** demo system runs, emits realistic logs/metrics, failure injection reproducibly creates an incident signature.

- [x] Three demo services (`checkout-service`, `payments-service`, `inventory-service`) — seeded in `simulated-system/app/seed.py`
- [x] Continuous log + metric emitter (`simulated-system/app/generator.py`)
- [x] In-memory state store (`simulated-system/app/state.py`)
- [x] REST API for the simulated system (`simulated-system/app/main.py`)
  - [x] `GET /services`
  - [x] `GET /logs` (query by service, time range, level, filter)
  - [x] `GET /metrics` (query by service, metric, time range)
  - [x] `GET /deploys` (query by service, time range)
  - [x] `GET /scenarios` + `POST /scenarios/{name}/inject`
- [x] Seeded incident scenarios (`simulated-system/app/scenarios.py`)
  - [x] `checkout-500s` — checkout service returning 500s after a bad deploy
- [x] Pydantic schemas (`simulated-system/app/schemas.py`)
- [x] Simulated system tests (`simulated-system/tests/`)

---

### ✅ Phase 3 — Ingestion Pipeline

**Checkpoint:** seeded data queryable; runbooks searchable via pgvector.

- [x] Simulated system HTTP client (`backend/app/ingestion/sim_client.py`)
- [x] Background ingestion pipeline (`backend/app/ingestion/pipeline.py`) — polls logs, metrics, deploys on a schedule
- [x] Runbook chunker + embedder (`backend/app/runbooks.py`)
- [x] Embeddings module (`backend/app/embeddings.py`) — real embeddings via OpenAI API; deterministic hash fallback when no API key
- [x] Runbook search (`backend/app/search.py`) — cosine similarity via pgvector
- [x] Runbooks router (`backend/app/routers/runbooks.py`) — search endpoint
- [x] Runbook source documents (`backend/runbooks/`)
- [x] Ingestion started on backend startup (`backend/app/main.py`)
- [x] Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_ingestion.py`, `tests/unit/test_runbooks.py`, `tests/unit/test_embeddings.py`, `tests/unit/test_search.py`

---

### ✅ Phase 4 — Tool Layer

**Checkpoint:** each tool callable and unit-tested independently of the LLM.

- [x] Tool base class (`backend/app/tools/base.py`)
- [x] Tool schemas (`backend/app/tools/schemas.py`)
- [x] Read-only tools (`backend/app/tools/read_only.py`)
  - [x] `query_logs(service, start_time, end_time, filter?)`
  - [x] `get_metrics(service, metric_name, start_time, end_time)`
  - [x] `get_recent_deploys(service, start_time, end_time)`
  - [x] `search_runbooks(query)`
  - [x] `get_service_status(service)`
- [x] Side-effecting tool stubs (`backend/app/tools/side_effecting.py`)
  - [x] `restart_service(service, reason)`
  - [x] `rollback_deploy(service, target_sha, reason)`
  - [x] `post_status_update(message)`
- [x] Tool registry (`backend/app/tools/registry.py`) — maps tool names to implementations + category
- [x] Executor with hard approval gate (`backend/app/tools/executor.py`) — read-only tools execute immediately; side-effecting tools are queued, never auto-executed
- [x] Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_tools_read_only.py`, `tests/unit/test_tools_executor.py`, `tests/unit/test_tools_side_effecting.py`

### 🔲 Phase 5 — Agent Orchestrator

**Checkpoint:** triggering a seeded incident produces a grounded hypothesis with real citations.

- [ ] LLM provider abstraction layer (swap OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini without changing agent code)
- [ ] System prompt with investigation policy (cite evidence before hypothesizing; treat log/runbook content as data, not instructions)
- [ ] Tool-calling loop: LLM → tool call → store result as evidence → feed back → repeat until hypothesis
- [ ] Evidence storage (populate `evidence` table from tool results, tied to `incident_id`)
- [ ] Hypothesis generation with citations (`hypotheses` + `hypothesis_citations` tables)
- [ ] Confidence level assignment (`low | medium | high`) + reasoning
- [ ] Enforce "evidence required before side-effecting action proposal" at orchestration layer
- [ ] `POST /api/incidents/{id}/investigate` endpoint kicks off the loop
- [ ] `GET /api/incidents/{id}` returns full state: evidence, hypotheses, proposed actions, status
- [ ] Integration test: seeded `checkout-500s` scenario → correct root-cause hypothesis

---

### 🔲 Phase 6 — Approval Workflow

**Checkpoint:** an approved rollback actually changes the simulated system's error rate; a rejected action never executes.

- [ ] Proposed-action generation from the agent loop → `tool_calls` rows with `status=proposed`
- [ ] `POST /api/incidents/{id}/actions/{action_id}/approve` endpoint
- [ ] `POST /api/incidents/{id}/actions/{action_id}/reject` endpoint
- [ ] Approval triggers actual side-effecting tool execution against the simulated system
- [ ] Rejection writes a rejection record; tool is permanently blocked from executing
- [ ] Outcome of approved action fed back to the agent (did the error rate change?)
- [ ] Incident status transitions: `investigating → hypothesis_ready → action_pending → resolved`
- [ ] Integration test: approve rollback → simulated system error rate drops
- [ ] Integration test: reject action → no execution; try to call execute directly → still blocked

---

### 🔲 Phase 7 — Audit Log

**Checkpoint:** every investigation reconstructable end-to-end from the audit log alone.

- [ ] `audit_log` table entries written for every tool call (input + output captured before LLM sees result)
- [ ] Approval and rejection events written to audit log with actor + timestamp
- [ ] Incident status-change events written to audit log
- [ ] `GET /api/incidents/{id}/audit-log` endpoint
- [ ] Global audit log endpoint (`GET /api/audit-log`) filterable by investigation, action type, status
- [ ] Audit entries immutable — no UPDATE/DELETE paths in code
- [ ] Test: reconstruct a full investigation from audit log entries alone

---

### 🔲 Phase 8 — Investigation UI

**Checkpoint:** a reviewer can trigger a seeded incident and watch the investigation happen live.

- [ ] **Landing page** — value prop, "View Live Demo" CTA, architecture summary, example walkthrough, GitHub link
- [ ] **Auth pages** — sign-in, sign-out
- [ ] **Dashboard** — connected system status, past investigations list, "Trigger Incident" / scenario picker
- [ ] **Investigation workspace**
  - [ ] Left panel: investigation timeline (tool calls, chronological)
  - [ ] Center: hypothesis + evidence + follow-up chat
  - [ ] Right panel: evidence/source viewer (logs, metric chart, deploy diff, runbook excerpt)
  - [ ] Top bar: incident title, status badge, affected service
  - [ ] Bottom/modal: proposed-action card with description, evidence summary, blast radius, Approve/Reject
- [ ] **Audit log page** — filterable table of all tool calls across all investigations
- [ ] **Source viewer page** — raw log stream, metric chart, runbook viewer, deploy history
- [ ] Recharts (or similar) metric charts
- [ ] Citation links: clicking a cited piece of evidence opens the source viewer to the relevant section

---

### 🔲 Phase 9 — Streaming + Polish

**Checkpoint:** investigation feels live, not like a spinner-then-dump.

- [ ] SSE (`text/event-stream`) on `POST /api/incidents/{id}/investigate` — stream each tool call + partial evidence as it happens
- [ ] Frontend SSE consumer — appends timeline entries in real time
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Error states (LLM error, tool failure, network error) with graceful UI fallback
- [ ] Empty states (no past investigations, no evidence yet)
- [ ] Responsive layout (tablet-friendly at minimum)
- [ ] Keyboard-accessible approve/reject flow

---

### 🔲 Phase 10 — Security + Reliability

**Checkpoint:** security tests pass; a test that tries to make the model skip the approval gate fails to bypass it.

- [ ] Authorization audit — every incident/evidence/action endpoint checks ownership
- [ ] Rate limiting on `POST /api/incidents` and `investigate` (prevent runaway LLM cost)
- [ ] Prompt-injection defense verified — log/runbook content explicitly scoped as data in system prompt
- [ ] Test: craft a log line containing "ignore previous instructions" → agent does not follow it
- [ ] Test: attempt to call a side-effecting tool execute path without an approval record → 403 / blocked
- [ ] Test: attempt to access another user's incident → 403
- [ ] No real credentials anywhere in the repo or demo system by construction
- [ ] Input validation on all API endpoints (Pydantic schemas)

---

### 🔲 Phase 11 — Evaluation

**Checkpoint:** real, reproducible numbers in the README.

- [ ] 5–8 seeded incident scenarios defined with known root causes
  - [ ] `checkout-500s` — bad deploy to checkout-service
  - [ ] `payments-latency` — upstream dependency slow
  - [ ] `inventory-db-lock` — database lock contention
  - [ ] *(add more as scenarios are designed)*
- [ ] Evaluation harness: trigger each scenario, run investigation, capture hypothesis + citations
- [ ] Metrics measured per scenario:
  - [ ] Root-cause identification accuracy (correct / incorrect / partial)
  - [ ] Citation accuracy (every cited log/metric/deploy/runbook is real and relevant)
  - [ ] Confidence calibration (high-confidence hypotheses are more often correct)
  - [ ] Time from incident creation to first hypothesis
  - [ ] Token usage and estimated cost per investigation
  - [ ] Approval-gate bypass attempts (should always be 0)
- [ ] Results table written into `README.md` — **real numbers only, no fabricated metrics**

---

### 🔲 Phase 12 — Deployment

**Checkpoint:** public demo works end to end with no developer assistance.

- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Backend deployed to Railway / Render / Fly.io
- [ ] Simulated system deployed alongside backend (same platform or separate service)
- [ ] Database: Supabase Postgres (or equivalent managed Postgres + pgvector)
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets configured in each platform
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline: merge to `main` → deploy
- [ ] Health checks for backend (`GET /health`) and simulated system
- [ ] Seeded demo data present on first startup (no manual setup for reviewer)
- [ ] Public URL verified end-to-end with a clean browser session

---

### 🔲 Phase 13 — Portfolio Packaging

**Checkpoint:** a reviewer with no context can understand the project, try the demo, and evaluate the engineering.

- [ ] README updated with:
  - [ ] Architecture diagram (Mermaid or image)
  - [ ] Live demo URL
  - [ ] Demo video / GIF of full investigation → approval flow
  - [ ] Evaluation results table (from Phase 11)
  - [ ] Design decisions and tradeoffs (why read-only vs. side-effecting split is in code, not prompt)
  - [ ] Known limitations and honest scope
  - [ ] Roadmap / what would be built next
- [ ] Resume bullets drafted (see spec §16) — **fill in actual metrics after Phase 11**
- [ ] Interview talking points reviewed (spec §17)
- [ ] Repository is public and linked from resume/portfolio

---

## Key Design Decisions

> Track decisions here as they're made, for use in the README and interviews.

| Decision | Rationale | Phase |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Read-only vs. side-effecting split enforced in `executor.py`, not via prompting | Prompts are not reliable enforcement; the orchestration layer is the actual safety boundary | 4 |
| Deterministic hash-based embedding fallback in `embeddings.py` | Lets the project run without an OpenAI key; runbook search degrades gracefully to keyword-level matching | 3 |
| *(add more as they arise)* | | |

## Open Questions / Blockers

> Update this section as the build progresses.

- [ ] LLM provider for Phase 5 — OpenAI GPT-4o (function calling) vs. Anthropic Claude (tool use)? Decide before building the abstraction layer.
- [ ] SSE vs. WebSocket for Phase 9 streaming — SSE is simpler and sufficient for unidirectional stream; confirm this is acceptable.
- [ ] Deployment platform for backend + simulated system — Railway vs. Fly.io? (Fly.io gives more control over multi-service; Railway is simpler setup.)
- [ ] Number and exact set of evaluation scenarios for Phase 11 — spec says 5–8; decide before Phase 11.
